# Distracted Driver Detection
Here I tried to take on the [State Farm Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/overview) challenge on Kaggle from 2015. The training dataset had a total of 22424 images divided into the following 10 classes: safe driving, texting - right, texting - left, talking on the phone - right, talking on the phone - left, operating the radio, drinking, reaching behind, hair and makeup and talking to passenger.
